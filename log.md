# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed CodeWars Katas:
1. Even or Odd
2. Surface Area and Volume of a Box
3. Remove String Spaces
4. Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'.


**Thoughts:** 
It was not easy to start as I couldn't decide what I should do first - start a bigger project or complete some smaller ones. Finally I decided to complete some CodeWars Katas as a warm up.

### Day 2: December 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed CodeWars Katas:
1. Area of a square
2. Convert a string to an array
3. Grasshopper - check for factor
4. A wolf in sheep's clothing
5. Abbreviate a two word name
6. Fing numbers which are divisible by given number
7. Grasshopper - summation


**Thoughts:** 
Thanks to Katas I practice array and string methods, among others. Every day I feel that it is easier for me to find a better solution, although sometimes after checking solutions of others I can learn a lot and use better and much shorter solutions in the future. Plan for tomorrow - start to code some small project, maybe a quiz? I'm looking forward to it!

### Day 3: December 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Solved Leet Code problems:
1. Two Sum (number 1)
2. Palindrome Number (number 9)
3. Single Number (numer 136)

**Thoughts:** 
Inspired by YouTube video I signed in on Leet Code website and it made me so involved I've spent more than hour solving tasks. I completed three of them and started the fourth one but I still can't figure out the solution.

### Day 4: December 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Solved Code Wars Katas:
1. Sum The Strings
2. The Wide-Mouthed frog!
3. Convert a String to a Number!
4. Return Negative
5. Do you speak "English"?
6. Sum of positive
7. Will there be enough space?
8. L1: Set Alarm

I also started to code a header with a navbar and call-to-action section for a new website project received from CodersLab as part of Portolio Lab.

**Thoughts:** 
I need to practice reduce and filter methods as I use them too rarely. 
I learned about the RegExp test() method today and I read its documentation.

### Day 5: December 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
I almost finished the header I mentioned yesterday in the log. I added some Routing as well as styled the component a bit to be as similar to given graphic project as possible. 
Then I started a course on freeCodeCamp from a scratch. Finished 22 of 28 HTML/HTML5 lessons from Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** 
I think I will continue the course on freeCodeCamp. 
While working on the header I had some issues with an image inside a div in this section. Image was outside the div. I fixed it but it taught me that learning of CSS can't be neglected.

### Day 6: December 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Two Katas on Code Wars done: 
1. All Star Code Challenge #18
2. Welcome!
I also finished 6 HTML/HTML5 lessons from Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** 
Saturday is a hard day to code for me. Maybe not the whole Saturday but the evening because of the meetings with friends. Next Saturday I need to code earlier. 

### Day 7: December 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**:
I was working on my version of 'oddaj-rzeczy' project from Coders Lab Portfolio Lab. I created navbar with Link from React Scroll and styled it. Fixed issue with width of header's elements. 

**Thoughts:** 
It was more than 1 hour of working on the project because I needed to rebuild the structure of React components and Sass folder. Dividing the code for smaller parts makes it more readable for me.

### Day 8: December 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**:
Four Katas from Code Wars done:
1. Find the longest gap!
2. Array plus array
3. Is n divisible by x and y?
4. Super Duper Easy

I also watched two videos regarding Map, Reduce and Filter to understand it better.

**Thoughts:** 
I've learned how a number can be easily changed to binary in JS. 8 kyu Katas are easier for me than before. I think I will try also some 7 kyu Katas tomorrow.

### Day 9: December 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**:
I finished a header section in React project from Portfolio Lab. It is based on a mockup I'd received. Created few components and styled them in SASS.

**Thoughts:** 
Since I need to finish the project before deadline, I will work on it more often now.

### Day 10: December 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**:
It was a day with FreeCodeCamp (Responsive Web Design Certification module). 

**Thoughts:** 
It's hard to focus when you have a flu...

### Day 11: December 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**:
I continued with my React project from Portfolio Lab - added few components and styled them based on the mock-up I received.

**Thoughts:** 
I am satisfied with the results of today's progress. To be continued... :) 

### I had a long break because of broken computer, going abroad and Christmas time, so I'm starting 2020 with new energy. I start this challenge again!

### Day 1: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
I completed Responsive Web Design Principles and CSS Flexbox lessons, as well as 30% of CSS Grid lesson from freecodecamp website.

**Thoughts:** 
I was just a recap.
